# Low-Level Coding Camp

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of low-level programming projects designed to build a strong foundation in C programming, memory management, data structures, and systems programming concepts. The projects progress from basic syntax and control structures to advanced topics like linked lists, bit manipulation, and file I/O.

## Curriculum Structure

The projects are organized in increasing difficulty, covering key concepts such as:

* Basic syntax and control flow (if, else, while)

* Functions and nested loops

* Debugging 

* Pointers, arrays, and strings

* Recursion

* Memory management with malloc and free

* Preprocessor directives

* Structures and typedefs

* Function pointers and variadic functions

* Linked lists and more complex data structures

* Bit manipulation

* File input/output operations

* Hash tables

* Makefiles

* Search algorithms
