Description
This is the first project of the C Programming Bootcamp (0x00-hello_world).
It introduces the basics of C programming, the compilation process, and the use of the gcc compiler.

The goal of this project is to get comfortable with:

Writing and compiling C programs

Using gcc to compile source code

Understanding the steps of compilation (preprocessing, compilation, assembly, linking)

Running simple C code that outputs text

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Explain what the C language is

Understand what happens when you type gcc main.c

Define entry points (main) in C

Print text using printf, puts, and putchar

Write simple C programs

Understand the compilation process:

Preprocessor

Compiler

Assembler

Linker

Work with source files (.c) and headers (.h)

Project Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All code must be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the following flags:

bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
Code should follow the Betty style guide

No use of global variables

No more than 5 functions per file

Use of standard C library functions allowed (printf, puts, etc.)

Each file should end with a new line

Files

4-puts.c	C program that prints a string using puts
5-printf.c	C program that prints a string using printf
6-size.c	C program that prints the size of various data types
100-intel	Script that generates assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C file
